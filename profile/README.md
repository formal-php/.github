## About Formal

The Formal (Functional, Object Relation Mapping, Access Layer) organization intends to create a unified way to handle persisted data in a declarative and memory safe way.

This is done via Monads.

Through this approach it is possible for you to write code that persists and retrieve data that works in standard HTTP context, long living processes and asynchronously without changing your code.
